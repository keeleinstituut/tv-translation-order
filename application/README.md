PS! Some notifications that are related to the project are sent out out side of workflow (e.g sub-projects workflows are not started but the PM will receive a message to review the project): 
* if PM was selected when client submitted the project (status "Registreeritud") 
    1. selected PM will receive a notification that new project is assigned to them.
    2. client will receive a notification that the project is registered 
* When PM cancels the project (status "TÃ¼histatud"): 
    * PM will receive a notification that the project is canceled 
    * client will receive a notification that the project is canceled 
* When ALL the sub-projects of the project are finished (sub-project statuses "Teostatud"): 
    * the client will receive a notification 
    * the PM will receive a notification
